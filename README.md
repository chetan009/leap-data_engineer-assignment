# Introduction

You've been invited to complete this data engineering coding assignment. We have deliberately designed this assignment to be open-ended in order to leave plenty of room for you 
to make choices. Please document your Pyspark code.  We do not expect you to spend days on this nor to build a full-blown application.

Good luck!

## Assignment

In this repository you'll find a directory with files containing energy meter-data.

Please build a PySpark solution that reads in the data and writes out a table with the energy usage for each meter at each 15 minute interval, including additional data fields 
with the hourly averaged energy usage and a flag indicating missing intervals.  The only requirement is that the solution should only include native PySpark (and thereby no UDFs).

The solution should be a generic solution for this problem and not tailored to the data provided.

Please provide your Pyspark code to this assignment along with your application to the data engineering position at Leap. We are looking forward to your solution!
